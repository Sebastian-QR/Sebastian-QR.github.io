Hello! Nice of you to stop by. My name is Sebastian Quezada Rojas and I am a Biotechnology Engineer of Latin American descent with a passion for science and critical thinking, an obsession with data and innovation, and a knack to fix things around the house using simple, leftover or discarded materials. I obtained a MSc in Biotechnology in Chile by designing a recombinant vaccine against Avian Pathogenic Escherichia coli, and I got my PhD here in Australia studying the genetics (RNA Seq) and microstructure (MRI) of the cortical plate of the fetal sheep cortex as it adopts its folding pattern. I have also worked in pulmonary research, cardiovascular research, and brain injury, repair and regeneration research. I have done a fair bit of researching around! In fact, it's been over 10 years of scientific career! And just like biological beings, scientific careers also evolve -- it is now time to move onto the field of data science to embrace a brighter, data-driven future.

My mission is to deliver simple but effective and innovative solutions. This applies not only to data and science, but to life in general. I believe things should be efficient, logical and reproducible, and I go out of my way to make things happen within deadlines. I am continually learning new ways of doing things, new approaches to analyse data, and always doing so with an open mind -- always searching for better ways to deliver results, insights and visualisations.

So, what do you have in mind? Is there something I can help you deliver? Or are you looking for someone to collaborate? Shoot me an email, or contact me via LinkedIn. I'm always here to help!
